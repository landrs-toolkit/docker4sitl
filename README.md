Docker4SITL aims to run SITL (Software In The Loop) of [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) with Docker. So with this solution, any operating systems which support Docker could be run SITL. 

To connect the LANDRS TOAST, enter ```output add tcpin:0.0.0.0:5761``` into the console to allow TOAST to connect via port 5761.

For MAC requires socat, install with ```brew install socat```.

Run with,
```
$ ./startSITLSimulator_MACOSX.sh copter --console --map
```

For information, the SITL (software in the loop) simulator allows you to run Plane, Copter or Rover without any hardware for ArduPilot project. It is a build of the autopilot code using an ordinary C++ compiler, giving you a native executable that allows you to test the behaviour of the code without hardware. 

# Prerequites

* Docker
* XQuartz (server X) for Mac OS X => `brew cask install xquartz`
* socat (Multipurpose relay - SOcket CAT) for Mac OS X => `brew install socat`

# Build yourself the Docker image

* Clone the project

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mickaelbaron/docker4sitl.git
```

* Go to _docker4sitl_ directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd docker4sitl
$ docker build -t docker4sitl src/.
```

# Import the image

```bash
$ docker load < sitl.tar.gz
```

# Run SITL

Execute the startSITMSimulator_XXX.sh script where XXX is your operating system (only MAC_OS X is actually supported. Your contributions are welcome).

The parameters are the following
  * plane, rover and copter

  * classical options for [sim_vehicle.py](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py). Note the `--aircraft` option is already used into the script with a fix value. The simulation logs will be stored into the host (see the next section).  

As example, start SITL simulator for Rover with console and map

```
$ ./startSITLSimulator_MACOSX.sh rover --console --map
```

To load a mission

```
$ wp load ../Tools/autotest/ArduPlane-Missions/CMAC-toff-loop.txt
```

Run the command “arm throttle” followed by “mode auto”

```
$ arm throttle
$ mode auto
```

# Directories during execution

When you start the script for the first time, two directories will be created on the Host

* _build_sitl_: contains the compilation result for the targeted vehicle

* _logs_: contains state and logs for each vehicle
